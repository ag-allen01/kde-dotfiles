Here are my dotfiles :)

I tried to include everything I could think of. There's also an additional colors.txt that has the base colors for my scheme that you can use to theme any other programs.

Wallpapers folder has my desktop wallpapers and the images I use as firefox backgrounds. The only two extentions needed to replicate my firefox look is Firefox Color and Tabliss. 

The icon pack I use is Papirus Icon Theme (https://github.com/PapirusDevelopmentTeam/papirus-icon-theme)
I also use Krohnkite to tile windows on KDE (https://github.com/esjeon/krohnkite)

Hope you enjoy!
